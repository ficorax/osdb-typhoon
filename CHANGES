Release 1.11.0 (Sun Oct 3 1999)

    1. Cleanup release based on 1.10.3. (See ``ChangeLog''). Many, many
       problems were fixed:
       - use of implicit int in declarations;
       - undeclared functions being called---many headers added;
       - parameters not being converted to the correct type
         if compiling without ANSI C prototypes;
       - broken configure script not making correct decisions---for example
         disabling prototypes even though GCC is being used;
       - preference given to GNU tools, like bison over yacc;
       - tools falling out of main() without returning exit status;
       - use of invalid void main() construct;
       - mismatched types in printf() calls;
    2. Fixed bug in tyexport and tyimport programs caused by
       calling fclose on the wrong FILE * pointer. These tools were
       totally broken because of this and wouldn't export or import; 
       they would crash after parsing the import or export spec.
    3. Added support for POSIX fcntl() locking, which is used in
       preference to lockf(). The lockf() emulation on Linux using flock()
       is gone.
